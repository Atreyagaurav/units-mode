* units-global-mode

This mode uses [[https://www.gnu.org/software/units/units.html][gnu units]] to facilitate unit conversions inside emacs.

*This package is a work in progress*

* Features
- [X] convert region to other units
- [ ] check ~--conformable~ units


* Example

If you have

    L = 23 ft

And you ran ~units-convert-region-and-insert~ while selecting ~23 ft~ you'll be asked for target unit and with ~mm~ you get:

    L = 23 ft = 7010.4 mm

Similarly,

    g = 9.81 m/s^2
    g = 9.81 m/s^2 = 32.185039 ft/s^2

There is completion for the target unit, that is non-exhaustive as it only includes defined units and not derived ones like ~ft/s^2~

Running ~units-convert-region~ will just show the converted results in the minibuffer.

If there is errors, like units aren't matched then it'll end with the error from ~units~
